# Computer Networks Programs
This repository contains Computer Networks lab programs with their source code .

## Programs List
1. Develop a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).
2. Develop a program to implement a sliding window protocol in the data link layer.
3. Develop a program to find the shortest path between vertices using the Bellman-Ford and path 
vector routing algorithm.
4. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name 
and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.
5. Develop a program on a datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client 
side, typed at the server side.
6. Develop a program for a simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.
7.  Develop a program for congestion control using a leaky bucket algorithm.
